# The Aether - BTA Port

The legendary dimension is finally here for Better Than Adventure!
New dimension, plethora of blocks and items.
3 dungeons and bosses to conquer.
Brand new compatibility between the two as well.

"This mod is an Aether addon made to make the original Aether mod compatible with BTA. We have no relation to the Aether team or the BTA team.

Although this is a clean rewrite of the mod, we do not ship  any assets or copyrighted content. They are extracted from the jar automatically on runtime."
